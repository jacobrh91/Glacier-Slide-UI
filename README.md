# Glacier Slide

Welcome to Glacier Slide, a simple puzzle game where to navigate from the start
to the end.

This UI relies on the [Rust backend server](https://github.com/jacobrh91/Glacier-Slide) to be set up and running on
"http://localhost:7878" to fetch new levels.

Found here

## Getting Started

First, run the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to play the game.
